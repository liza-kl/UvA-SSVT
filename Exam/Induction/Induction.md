1. Find the **explicit** form  -> Basically try to see the function as an 
"arithmetic" sequence and calculate it for a bunch of numbers and then see how
you can write it without recusrion.

2. Then do the whole induction stuff (or just put the formula into Wolframaloha)
2.1. Prove Basecase
2.2. Assume n + 1 
2.3. Prove!
