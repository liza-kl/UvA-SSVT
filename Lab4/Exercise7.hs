    -- They are not the same? 
    
    -- Haha, it depends on the domain which you are using it. 

    -- It depends on the set you are using.

    -- e.g. For the relation: [(1,2),(2,3)] they are indeed the same.

    -- trclos [(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)]

-- transitive closure has identiy in symmetric closure
-- Symmetric Closure and Transitive closure can be the same if you have an empty set or only identity sets inside
-- of it 

-- Maybe reason with some commuative law etc.

    -- You can prob remove the duplicates of the transitive closure 
    -- as this is not expected so you have both cases covered
