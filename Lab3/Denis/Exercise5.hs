    The way we check for property equivalence is generally by using the "mutate'" function for the different properties we try to compare to.
    Then we just compare the two different boolean lists together and if those two lists are equivalent we assume that the properties are equivalent to each other.
    
    This approach in reality is kind of flawed though, since this implies a dependency of equivalence checking two properties with the tested function (and the amount of mutants), which isn't the case.
    (Most likely... We can't come up with formal proof that if a function changes the property equivalence still stays. But is just feels weird/inelegant to have this dependency, since properties are sort of logical operators and you should be able to check equivalence with each other on a more formal and isolated basis...)
    
    That is due to the way we are doing mutation testing though.
    We are just "swapping" out the function outputs with each other, so in a way we aren't "really mutation testing".
    And this fact we can't really "logically" check if two properties are equivalent (without using the function) to each other kind of abuses this fact.
    This is since all of the generated metrics aren't really mutation testing metrics but just "output swapping metrics", how strong the properties are in that regard and the limited data type (of just Integers).
    Therefore we can't really test for real equivalence, since we have no way to show it. (Without some really scuffed AST or source code manipulation, to do real mutation testing. Ain't nobody got time for that, I guess...)

    So in reality you would need to check up on property equivalence in a different, more logic-based way way.
    We can't really do that here though.
    So we just compare the mutated output lists for equivalence.

    We create a map with the property and it's mutation tested output and then combine properties together, which have the same boolean maps (mutation survivors/kills).

    From this we can create a list, which contain lists of properties which are equal to each other by mapping them together and have a list of equivalent properties.
    Based on that we can also check for property subsets. We use the same approach as in exercise 3. So see exercise 3 for subset generation.
