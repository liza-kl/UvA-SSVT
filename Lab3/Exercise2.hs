-- ## Deliverables ##
-- implementation, documentation of approach, effect of using different mutators/properties, indication of time spent
-- Time spent: 240 min (documentation takes time)

-- ## Documentation of Approach ##
-- In an imperative approach I would use a count variable and increment it if a mutant survives 
    -- in functional I'd need to use recursion for that.
    -- a number of mutants (modified output) is given (4000 in the FitSpec case)

-- I have to iterate over the properties and for each property iterate over the mutants and then return a bool whether it
-- survived or not. If it survived, increment up the count else do nothing. 

-- ## countSurvivors
-- First Argument: Number of mutants
-- Second Argument: Set of propertie(s) --> the list/set enables us to try out different
    -- combinations of properties (or testing them on their own).
-- Third argument: Provide one mutator which is going then to generate the number of prescribed mutants 
    -- Only one mutator, because if we take a list, we could not derive which property kills which kind of mutant. 
-- Fourth argument is the function under test
    -- In our case only the multiplication table 

-- So in the end the function filters the list of mutants which survive (true values) under the list of
-- properties passed, and return total no. of mutants of one kind (e.g. arbitraryList) surviving.

countSurvivors :: Integer -> [[Integer] -> Integer -> Bool] -> ([Integer] -> Gen [Integer]) -> (Integer -> [Integer]) -> Gen Integer
countSurvivors numberOfMutants props mutators fut =
    -- What's happening in the fmap?
    -- generateListOfSurvivedMutants generated the list of survived mutants
    -- for a property set (or to be more precise a list of [Gen Bool] which could indicate the amount of survived mutants,
    -- as we haven't filtered the list yet)

    -- Now we need to use the sequence function to convert
    -- the list of monads [Gen Bool] into one Monad of the type Gen [Bool]
    -- with the help of the functor fmap in the infix notation <$> (a normal map function would here not work since 
    -- we are in a monadic context and applying 3 functions in the function composition.

    -- starting with the inner von "filter", we filter for "True" Booleans (you could also filter for "id",
    -- but I find (== True) more readable.
    -- Then we have one list, and get the length out of it
    -- since the previous output is an "Int", we need to cast it to "Integer", another
    -- solution would be just to use the Int value in the function declaration, but Int
    -- is fixed, whereas Integer is not (well, in theory, practically it 
    -- is fixed by your hardware ressources)
