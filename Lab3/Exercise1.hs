-- ## List of Mutators and Rationale ##

    -- We want to check:
    -- - edge cases like empty lists
    -- - list length changes 
    -- - element value changes
    -- - patterns e.g. sort, reverse, shuffle, same-number list

    -- Outputs that are covered:
    -- 1) Add elements to start or end of list -> 
    --     - Strength: Increases list length.
    --     - Weakness: Only adds in the start or end of the list. Does not remove elements or check edge cases/patterns.
    -- 2) Remove random elements -> 
    --     - Strength: Decreases the list length. 
    --     - Weakness: Does not add elements or check edge cases/patterns.
    -- 3) Random list ->
    --     - Strength: Checks what happens with different data.
    --     - Weakness: Does not change the existing list.

    -- Outputs that are not covered:
    -- 1) Empty output list -> 
    --     - Strength: Checks the edge case of empty list.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove or modify elements. Does not check patterns.
    -- 2) Sort output list ->
    --     - Strength: Checks what happens with a sorted list.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove or modify elements.
    -- 3) Reverse output list -> 
    --     - Strength: Checks what happens with the reversed list.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove or modify elements.
    -- 4) Shuffle output list -> 
    --     - Strength: Checks what happens if we the elements are in different positions.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove or modify elements.
    -- 5) Negate output list ->
    --     - Strength: Checks what happens if the numbers are negative.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove or modify elements.
    -- 6) Replace random values in output list ->
    --     - Strength: Checks what happens if some values are changed.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove elements. Does not check patterns.
    -- 7) Output list that contains the same number ->
    --     - Strength: Checks the edge case of having duplicates.
    --     - Weakness: Does not add or remove elements. 
    -- 8) Add numbers in random spots 
    --     - Strength: Random numbers in random spots. Increases list length.
    --     - Weakness: Does not remove elements.  Does not check patterns.
    -- 9) An exact same list which could arise because of the arbitrary list generator
    --     - This would be a so-called "equivalent mutant" which unfortunately can't be really tested.
