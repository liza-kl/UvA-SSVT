    Procedure: 
        1) Remove implications and equivalences.
            I.E: Replace (P Impl Q) with Neg(P or Q)
            And replace (P Equiv Q) with (P or (Neg Q)) and ((Neg P) or Q)
        2) Move Neg's as much inside as possible using De Morgan's laws.
        3) Unsure if this applies here. Don't think so. Drop universal Quantifiers. (âˆ€)
        4) Distribute ORs inwards over ANDs by replacing... (P or (Q and R)) with ((P or Q) and (P or R))
