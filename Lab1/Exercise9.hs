    A permutation of a finite list is another finite list with the same elements,
    but possibly in a different order. 
    For example, [3,2,1] is a permutation of [1,2,3], but [2,2,0] is not. Write a function

    isPermutation :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
    that returns True if its arguments are permutations of each other.

    Next, define some testable properties for this function, 
    and use a number of well-chosen lists to test isPermutation .
    You may assume that your input lists do not contain duplicates.
    What does this mean for your testing procedure?
