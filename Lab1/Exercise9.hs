    A permutation of a finite list is another finite list with the same elements,
    but possibly in a different order. 
    For example, [3,2,1] is a permutation of [1,2,3], but [2,2,0] is not. Write a function

    isPermutation :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
    that returns True if its arguments are permutations of each other.

    Next, define some testable properties for this function, 
    and use a number of well-chosen lists to test isPermutation .
    You may assume that your input lists do not contain duplicates.
    What does this mean for your testing procedure?

{-- Test Report
- All tests are passing, we can automate the test process (we are using QuickCheck for that). Basically
a permutation is given if all the necessary properties are satisfied.
- If the list does not contain duplicates, we can assume that all given lists 
can create permutations (as repetitions are not allowed in permutations)
-- We weren't sure about the well chosen integer lists but it's probably covered by the provided edge cases
