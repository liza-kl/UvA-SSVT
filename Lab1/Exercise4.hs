    Give a Haskell implementation of a function  deran:: Int -> [[Int]]  that generates a list 
    of all derangements of the list  [0..n-1]

    Example of a derangement: [1,2,3] and [3,1,2] would be a derangement of the original list.

    In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set in which no element
    appears in its original position. In other words, a derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points.

-- QuickCheck properties

-- The number of permutations for an empty set equals to the factorial of 0 which is 1. 
-- Since no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position this means that this permutation is also a derangement. 
-- That is why the number of derangements for an empty set is one.
prop_numOf0PermutationsIsOne :: Property
prop_numOf0PermutationsIsOne = property( length ( deran 0 ) == 1 )

-- Since the list contains a single integer there isn't really a way to move that single integer around or even making any derangements out of that. 
-- Example: A "permutation" of [1] would always result in [1] which isn't a derangement thus having 0 derangements.
prop_numOf1PermutationsIsZero :: Property
prop_numOf1PermutationsIsZero = property( length ( deran 1 ) == 0 )

-- The list of all permutations is also always including the entire list of all derangements. 
-- Some permutations are no derangements though so the amount of derangements must be always smaller or equal the amount of permutations though.

    Question 4.4 

    Property 1 and 2 have equal strength and are stronger than the rest of the properties.
    This is due to them only checking for a singular value which corresponds an edge case.

    Property 3 and 4 also have equal strength but are weaker than 1/2 because they apply for the entire set of integer values.
    That makes them automatically weaker than property 1/2.


    Question 4.5 

    This test can be automatically tested (via QuickCheck) but only a small subset of the possible parameters can be checked. 
    This is due to factorial (time) complexity and infinitely large number of positive integer numbers.
