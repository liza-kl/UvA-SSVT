    This function counts the conjunctions

    If Atoms inside conjunctions are the same there is one less subformula when they are different.
    This is due to not including the simplest subformula for f2 since that is
    equivalent to the simplest subformula of f1.
    -> We needed to add this, because otherwise our prop_lengthOfSet failed.

Properties for 7.1
1.) The length of the set, which is returned by the sub a function should equals the
length of the nsub function (as this is proven by induction).

For counting the elements you could have probably used some form of the inclusion-exclusion principle,
as we are dealing with sets.

2.) The other property is, that the set of the subformulas should include the original formula 
(as this is a subformula as well.

3.) A very specific property is that the length of a single atom should equal the set of the prop
