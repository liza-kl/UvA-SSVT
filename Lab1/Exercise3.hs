Firstly, I implemented the properties according to the given type.
Also using "even", because it is also compared with the others.

Although "three" and "four" have the same implementation, it is still relevant to include them,
because the computer does not know, that they are equal.

{--1. "one" â€“ has the smallest set for which the function returns true [4,6,8,10], therefore it is the strongest (most specific one)
    2. "three" - [-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10]
    3. "four"  - [-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10] 
    4. "five" [-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10] three, four, five  are equivalent in strength, because the cardinality is the same.
    5. "two"  - is the weakest property because it applies to the largest set of the domain  [-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,5,6,7,8,10] --}
