data Boy = Matthew | Peter | Jack | Arnold | Carl
            deriving (Eq,Show)


-- 3 tell the truth, 2 are lying
-- Matthew: Carl didn't do it, and neither did I. He's accusing Peter, Jack, Arnold
-- Peter: It was Matthew or it was Jack.  He's accusing Matthew, Jack
-- Jack: Matthew and Peter are both lying. Negation of the accusements of Peter and Matthew
-- Arnold: Matthew or Peter is speaking the truth, but not both. Accusing the same people as Matthew or Peter, 
-- but Matthew accuses Arnold, so Arnold is probably supporting Peter (?)
-- Carl: What Arnold says is not true. Negation of Arnolds accusements
