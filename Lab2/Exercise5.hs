{-- This function receives the model and the implementation
    First of all, another function should be created that will convert the implementation to an IOLTS
        - will call the implementation function with 0 and any of these labels = ["open", "close", "lock", "unlock"]
        - and the repeat for states we get
        - then (state, label) tuples can be created and added to a list
        - catch any exceptions occured
        - call createIOLTS with this list
    Then, testLTSAgainstSUT will just call ioco with the two IOLTS's and return the result
