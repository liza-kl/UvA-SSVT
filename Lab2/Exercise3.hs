-- Constaining suspension traces, as otherwise we could run into a problem where the list goes on for forever.
-- So no testing would be possible (due to the infinite list)
-- First thought: Checking for tau might not be that useful:
-- Second thought: A delta can be followed with a delta forever – stop the generation of the trace after 2 loops
-- 2 loops – to show that it is possible to loop.
